# Pro Sessions MT4

## Description
This code is a sample implementation of the Pro Sessions MT4 indicator developed by the Forex Robot Easy team. It is designed to optimize trades by providing session-related data and functionality.

The code defines a session structure called `Session`, which contains four datetime variables: `open`, `high`, `low`, and `close`. It also declares an array called `sessions` to store session data.

The variable `asrPeriod` is used to define the period for calculating the Average Session Range (ASR). The ASR is calculated using the custom function `CalculateASR`, which takes a session index as input and returns the average range for that session.

The code also includes a custom function called `DrawSession`, which is responsible for drawing session lines or rectangles on the chart. It takes a session index and a boolean value `extendLine` as inputs and uses the `open` and `close` datetime values of the session to determine the start and end times. If `extendLine` is true and the session index is less than 3, the end time is extended to the opening time of the next session.

The `ToggleSession` function is used to hide or show a session based on the session index. It provides the ability to toggle the visibility of each session individually.

The `PredictSessionLevels` function is responsible for predicting session levels based on previous data. It uses an algorithm or strategy to generate these predictions.

The `DisplayOHLC` function is used to display the Open, High, Low, and Close (OHLC) levels for each session. It retrieves the OHLC data from the `sessions` array and displays it on the chart.

The `InitializeSessions` function is used to initialize the session data based on historical data. It prepares the `sessions` array with the necessary data for the indicator to work properly.

The `HandleHotkey` function handles the hotkey functionality, allowing users to toggle the visibility of sessions using the number keys (1, 2, 3, 4). It takes a key code as input and calls the `ToggleSession` function accordingly.

The `OnStart` function is the entry point of the program. It initializes the session data, displays the OHLC levels, predicts session levels, draws session lines or rectangles, and handles hotkey functionality.

## Usage
